            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <div type="response_to_declaration">
               <head>The An≈øwer.</head>
               <p>THe di≈øturbances that are in this Kingdome have growne through the interferring of the Commi≈ø≈øion of Array with the <hi>Militia</hi> ordained by Parliament.</p>
               <p>The Officers in the <hi>Militia</hi> are the ≈øame for the mo≈øt part that were before in the Lievtenancy, the men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by His Maje≈øty; the Array invades the <hi>Militia,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:112272:3"/>and hath beene the onely meanes of breaking the peace. So in <hi>Sommer≈øet</hi> Captaine <hi>Pre≈øton</hi> was a≈ø≈øayled and his En≈øigne ≈ølaine in the execution of the ordinance of Parliament. And for that cau≈øe the authors and fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of that crime are pro≈øecuted in <hi>Sherbourne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That many places of this County are po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed with the doubt of an arbitrary government intended is true, That the fault therof is layd to the Kings charge is fal≈øe, That the Commi≈ø≈øioners of Array doe for the extent of that Commi≈ø≈øion put in practice an arbitrary and Tiran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall government is true for the≈øe rea≈øons.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt that which is but again≈øt the being of Parliaments is intended for an arbitrary government, but the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øioners of Array doe bend them≈øelves and the power of their Commi≈ø≈øions again≈øt the being of Parliaments.</p>
               <p>That the ≈øuppre≈ø≈øion of this Parliament, or the drawing of the members of it to other judicature, is again≈øt the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Parliaments, is ≈øo apparant as it needs no more proofe.</p>
               <p>Secondly That the Commi≈ø≈øion it ≈øelfe is illegall hath beene declared by an authority not to be contradicted. And to put an illegall Commi≈ø≈øion in execution as to draw his Maje≈øties government into the cen≈øure of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,</p>
               <p>Thirdly the Commi≈ø≈øion of Array is mo≈øt partiall and in that re≈øpect Tyrannicall. By the Declaration ju≈øtifying and explaining it, it is affirmed that a man of able body and e≈øtate ≈øerving in per≈øon ≈øhall find armes but for his per≈øon, but a man weake in body not ≈øerving ≈øhal find arms according to the proportion of his e≈øtate, ≈øo that by this rule a man of 40 <hi>li. per. an.</hi> and impotent ≈øhall find a mans arms &amp; a man to weare it; and a potent man of 100. 500. or 1000. <hi>per. an.</hi> ≈øhal find no more. A
<pb facs="tcp:112272:3"/>man that is potent in boby owes that ability to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth as the rich of his ≈øub≈øtance, why el≈øe is the poore able man bound to weare the impotent rich mans armes? It is mo≈øt unrea≈øonable then and con≈øequently mo≈øt illegall, that the bodily ≈øtrength of a rich man which is his great advantage ≈øhould be the rea≈øon to ea≈øe his e≈øtate, and the weakene≈ø≈øe of his equall draw upon him a gro≈ø≈øe inequallity of burthen.</p>
               <p>This Declaration averreth peremptorily, that this Commi≈ø≈øion (which is the thing undertaken) is lawfull, that it is not prejudiciall, that there is no authority to take ≈øixpence, and thereupon the holy Sacrament is ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly received.</p>
               <p>For the lawfulne≈ø≈øe a ≈øingle Iudgment is oppo≈øed to the Parliament and the con≈øcience bound without re≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation as ≈øurely for the truth of it.</p>
               <p>That's much in re≈øpect of the antiquity oft his law, the variety of others ≈øince made the difference of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But that it is not prejudiciall, let the before recited partiallity an≈øwer.</p>
               <p>And for the authority to take ≈øixpence ≈øee the power to impri≈øon the refu≈øers.</p>
               <p>With the will of any man Charity forbids to have to doe, becau≈øe his purpo≈øes are hid.</p>
               <p>But the con≈øequences of their actions are apparant to provident men.</p>
               <p>The Array doth apparently oppo≈øe the Parliament, and intrudes uppon tho≈øe offices which have beene and are now po≈ø≈øe≈øt by others for the peace and defence of the Kingdome.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Militia</hi> defends the Parliament, and therein ≈øtrives to maintaine the King and his po≈øterity in the ancient and rightfull government of this Realme by 3 e≈øtates.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:112272:4"/>
               <p>In this there is true loyalty and con≈øtant peace.</p>
               <p>In the other flattery and the ≈øeed of perpetuall War.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Militia</hi> protects Religion and propriety of goods, and for the Common intere≈øt in both craves the benefit or Parliament and Church a≈ø≈øemblyes.</p>
               <p>The Array prevaling will not faile to bring both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ≈øingle power at lea≈øt into the danger that both were lately in. But that's forgotten, neither is it ≈øeene that the Array mu≈øt embroyle this Kingdome, that the rebellion may prevaile in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
